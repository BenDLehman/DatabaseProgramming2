Todo:

1.	JDBC lastQuerySuccessful is not working as expected. If a query fails, it still returns true. 
	We need to get this to return the error instead.
2.	In TableGui once you've selected a table, you can still click on individual tuples and get a 
	message saying you can "click it to select it". We need to either get rid of it, or use it to
	create a little window/message giving more detail about the tuple. Maybe the constraints?
3.	Finish parseMetaData() in JDBC and connect it to the guis
4.	Make insert/update/delete buttons disabled into table is selected
5.	Finish update method in JDBC
6.	Fix window titles
