Todo:

1.	JDBC lastQuerySuccessful is not working as expected. If a query fails, it still returns true. 
	We need to get this to return the error instead.
2.	In TableGui once you've selected a table, you can still click on individual tuples and get a 
	message saying you can "click it to select it". We need to either get rid of it, or use it to
	create a little window/message giving more detail about the tuple. Maybe the constraints?
5.	Finish coding the custom query bar (connect to parseResultsSet() in jdbc and connect to gui)
6.	Code for checking constraints in queries
7.	Automate population of tables
