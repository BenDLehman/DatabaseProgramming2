Todo:

5.	Finish coding the custom query bar (connect to parseResultsSet() in jdbc and connect to gui)
9.	fix success/fail message
11.	General testing
12.	Add "instructions" on all the pages
14.	Fix Window Close confirmation. Closes regardless of what you press currently.
15.	Remove testSelect functions from JDBC when we're done using them as examples
16. Fix issue where gui will let you insert into a column that's not there
		modify
		num				WordsAndShit			Yeet
		-				something				-
		6				-						-
	Returns a successful query even though there is no num 6 in table (does not actually update table with new row):
	com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4PreparedStatement@5296204b: UPDATE TEST_DELETE SET WordsAndShit = 'something' WHERE Num = 6
